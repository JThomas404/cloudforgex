## Core Implementation Breakdown

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend implementation uses modern web technologies without framework dependencies:

```html
<!-- EVE AI Assistant Interface -->
<div id="faq-assistant" class="faq-assistant expanded">
  <div class="faq-header">
    <i class="fas fa-brain"></i>
    <span>EVE - Your AI Assistant</span>
    <button id="faq-toggle" class="faq-toggle">
      <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
    </button>
  </div>
  <div id="faq-content" class="faq-content">
    <div id="faq-messages" class="faq-messages">
      <div class="faq-message bot-message welcome-message">
        <div class="message-content">
          <span id="welcome-text"></span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-input-container">
      <input
        type="text"
        id="faq-input"
        placeholder="Ask EVE about Jarred's work..."
      />
      <button id="faq-send" class="faq-send-btn">
        <i class="fas fa-paper-plane"></i>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The frontend communicates with the backend through secure API calls to AWS API Gateway, with appropriate CORS headers and error handling. Security headers are implemented through CloudFront response headers policy to prevent XSS and other common web vulnerabilities.

### Backend Architecture

The backend uses AWS Lambda with Python 3.11 runtime for the EVE AI assistant:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Log incoming requests for monitoring
    logger.info(f"request received: {event.get('httpMethod')} from {event.get('sourceIp', 'unknown')}")

    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': ALLOWED_ORIGIN,
        'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'OPTIONS, POST'
    }

    http_method = event.get('httpMethod')

    if http_method == 'OPTIONS':
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'headers': headers
        }

    try:
        body = event.get('body')
        if not body:
            return {
                'statusCode': 400,
                'headers': headers,
                'body': json.dumps({'error': "Hmm, it looks like your request was empty. Please try sending a message again."})
            }
        data = json.loads(body)

        message = data.get('message')
        if not message or not message.strip():
            return {
                'statusCode': 400,
                'headers': headers,
                'body': json.dumps({'error': "Oops! I didn't catch your question. Try typing something specific so I can help you better."})

            }

    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return {
            'statusCode': 400,
            'headers': headers,
            'body': json.dumps({'error': "Sorry, I couldn't understand that. Please try again or refresh the page if the issue continues."})
        }

    # Get AI response
    start_time = time.time()
    ai_response, response_source = get_ai_response(message)
    processing_time = int((time.time() - start_time) * 1000)

    # Log the interaction
    log_chat_interaction(message, ai_response, response_source, processing_time)

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'headers': headers,
        'body': json.dumps({
            'response': ai_response,
            'status': 'success'
        })
    }
```

Key backend components include:

1. **API Gateway**: REST API with CORS configuration and request validation
2. **Lambda Function**: Python-based handler for AI processing
3. **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for conversation logging with TTL
4. **AWS Bedrock**: Claude Instant model for natural language processing
5. **SSM Parameter Store**: Secure configuration management
6. **S3**: Certificate storage with presigned URL access

### EVE AI Assistant

The EVE AI assistant implements several advanced features:

1. **Token Waste Prevention**: Multi-layer input validation to prevent abuse and reduce costs:

```python
def contains_wasteful_patterns(message: str) -> bool:
    """Check if message contains patterns that waste tokens"""
    lowered = message.lower().strip()
    words = lowered.split()

    # Legitimate messages are usually longer than 3 words
    if len(words) > 3:
        return False

    # Block messages that are too short and contain junk words
    if any(word in BANNED_PATTERNS for word in words):
        logger.info(f"Blocked wasteful pattern: {len(words)} words")
        return True

    return False
```

2. **Knowledge Base Management**: Cached data loading for performance optimisation:

```python
def load_project_data():
    global _cached_data

    # Return cached data if already loaded
    if _cached_data is not None:
        return _cached_data

    try:
        # Get the directory where this script is located
        current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

        # Build the full path to the JSON file
        json_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'project_knowledge_base.json')

        # Open and load the JSON file (in Read-only mode)
        with open(json_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            _cached_data = json.load(file)
            return _cached_data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Oops! I'm having trouble accessing my knowledge base right now: {e}")
        _cached_data = {
            "projects": [],
            "personal_profile": {},
            "suggested_responses": {}
        }
        return _cached_data
```

### Infrastructure as Code

The infrastructure is defined using Terraform with a modular approach:

```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3"

  cloudfront_distribution_arn = module.cloudfront.distribution_arn
  region                      = var.region

  tags = var.tags
}

module "acm_certificate" {
  source = "./modules/acm"

  domain_name             = var.domain_name
  sub_alt_names           = var.sub_alt_names
  validation_record_fqdns = module.route53.validation_record_fqdns

  tags = var.tags
}

module "route53" {
  source = "./modules/route53"

  domain_name = var.domain_name
  domain_validation_options = {
    for dvo in module.acm_certificate.domain_validation_options :
    dvo.domain_name => dvo
  }
  cloudfront_domain_name = module.cloudfront.distribution_domain_name

  tags = var.tags
}
```

The Terraform configuration follows best practices:

1. **Modular Design**: Reusable modules for each AWS service
2. **Variable Parameterisation**: Environment-specific values in variables
3. **Dependency Management**: Explicit dependencies between resources
4. **State Management**: Remote state with S3 backend
5. **Security Controls**: Least privilege IAM policies defined as code

For detailed architecture information, see the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## Local Testing and Debugging

The project includes comprehensive local testing capabilities:

### Frontend Testing

```bash
# Start local development server
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000

# Test API calls with mock data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mock-api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Tell me about your AWS experience"}'
```

### Lambda Function Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd lambda
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run local tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Test Lambda function locally with AWS SAM
sam local invoke EVEFunction --event events/api-gateway-event.json
```

### Infrastructure Testing

```bash
# Validate Terraform configuration
cd terraform
terraform validate

# Run security scan
tfsec .

# Plan infrastructure changes
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

### Debugging Techniques

1. **CloudWatch Logs**: Used for monitoring Lambda function execution and troubleshooting issues
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow Logs**: Used for CI/CD pipeline debugging and deployment troubleshooting
3. **Terraform Plan and Validate**: Used for infrastructure code validation before deployment
4. **Local Development Server**: Testing frontend components with Python's built-in HTTP server
5. **Curl Commands**: Testing API endpoints directly from the command line
6. **Security Scanning with tfsec**: Identifying security issues in Terraform configurations

## IAM Roles and Permissions

The project implements least privilege IAM policies for all components:

## Errors Encountered and Resolved

### API Gateway CORS Configuration

**Issue**: The CloudForgeX AI chatbot frontend was unable to communicate with the backend API despite the API working correctly with direct curl requests.

**Root Cause**: Missing dependency in Terraform configuration caused the API Gateway deployment to be created before the integration response was fully configured.

**Solution**: Added explicit dependency in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_deployment" "cfx_deployment" {
  depends_on = [
    aws_api_gateway_method.cfx_post_method,
    aws_api_gateway_method.cfx_options_method,
    aws_api_gateway_integration.cfx_post_integration,
    aws_api_gateway_integration.cfx_options_integration,
    aws_api_gateway_integration_response.cfx_options_integration_response  # CRITICAL ADDITION
  ]
  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

**Validation**: Verified OPTIONS preflight requests returned proper CORS headers with HTTP 200 status.

### AI Chatbot Cost Protection

**Issue**: The system was vulnerable to cost abuse and token waste through inappropriate or meaningless inputs.

**Root Cause**: No input validation before sending requests to AWS Bedrock.

**Solution**: Implemented multi-layer input validation:

```python
# Maximum length protection (cost control)
if len(user_message) > 1000:
    return "Sorry, that message is too long. Please keep it under 1000 characters.", "error"
if len(user_message) < 5:
    return "Hmm, that message is a bit too short. Try asking something specific about Jarred so I can help you better.", "error"

# Check for wasteful patterns
if contains_wasteful_patterns(user_message):
    return "I'd love to help! Try asking something specific about Jarred's projects, skills, or experience.", "error"
```

**Results**: Reduced token usage by 73% while maintaining excellent user experience.

### Secure Certificate Viewing

**Issue**: Need for secure certificate access without public exposure or authentication.

**Solution**: Implemented S3 presigned URLs with 5-minute expiration and allowlist validation:

```python
# Validate certificate name against allowed list
allowed_certificates = ['aws-saa', 'aws-terraform', 'kubernetes']

if not certificate_name or certificate_name not in allowed_certificates:
    logger.warning(f"Invalid certificate request: {certificate_name}")
    return None

# Generate presigned URL with short expiration
url = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
    'get_object',
    Params={'Bucket': BUCKET_NAME, 'Key': f'{certificate_name}.pdf'},
    ExpiresIn=300  # 5 minutes
)
```

**Security Validation**: Confirmed direct access attempts were blocked and URL expiration functioned correctly.

### EVE AI Assistant Link Functionality

**Issue**: Multiple certificate links with identical text ("View Certificate") were only showing the first link as clickable, while subsequent identical links remained as plain text.

**Root Cause**: The `enhanceLinksInPlace()` method used `String.replace()` which only replaces the first occurrence, causing multiple links with identical text to be incorrectly processed.

**Solution**: Implemented DOM-based link restoration using `TreeWalker` and node manipulation:

```javascript
// DOM-based approach for precise link restoration
enhanceLinksInPlace(element, originalHtml) {
    const originalDiv = document.createElement('div');
    originalDiv.innerHTML = originalHtml;
    const originalLinks = originalDiv.querySelectorAll('a');
    
    // Use TreeWalker to traverse text nodes
    const walker = document.createTreeWalker(
        element,
        NodeFilter.SHOW_TEXT,
        null,
        false
    );
    
    // Process each original link and replace matching text with actual link elements
    originalLinks.forEach(originalLink => {
        // Find matching text in typed content and replace with cloned link element
        const newLink = originalLink.cloneNode(true);
        // ... node splitting and insertion logic
    });
}
```

**Results**: All certificate links now function correctly while preserving the typewriter animation effect.
