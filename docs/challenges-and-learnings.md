## API Gateway CORS Configuration: Cross-Origin Request Failure

### Problem Statement

The CloudForgeX AI chatbot frontend was unable to communicate with the backend API despite the API working correctly with direct curl requests. Users experienced complete chatbot functionality failure with the error message "I'm having trouble connecting to my AI service right now."

**Specific Symptoms:**

- Browser console showed CORS policy errors:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://r7xn947zpk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat'
from origin 'https://www.jarredthomas.cloud' has been blocked by CORS policy:
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check:
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

- Direct API calls via curl worked correctly
- Lambda function was operational with AWS Bedrock integration working
- Only browser-based requests were failing

### Root Cause Analysis

A systematic investigation was conducted to isolate the issue:

1. **Direct API Testing**

   - Confirmed POST requests worked via curl
   - Verified Lambda function returned expected responses

2. **OPTIONS Preflight Request Testing**

   ```bash
   curl -X OPTIONS https://r7xn947zpk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat \
     -H "Origin: https://www.jarredthomas.cloud" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
     -v
   ```

   - Result: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
   - Response: `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

3. **API Gateway Configuration Inspection**

   ```bash
   aws apigateway get-integration --rest-api-id r7xn947zpk \
     --resource-id <resource-id> --http-method OPTIONS
   ```

   - Finding: Configuration appeared correct:
     - MOCK integration properly configured
     - Method response with CORS headers defined
     - Integration response with proper header mapping

4. **Terraform Deployment Analysis**
   - Examined deployment resource dependencies
   - Found critical issue: Missing dependency on `aws_api_gateway_integration_response`

**Root Cause Identified:**
The API Gateway deployment was created before the integration response was fully configured, resulting in:

- OPTIONS method returning HTTP 500 instead of HTTP 200
- Missing CORS headers in preflight response
- Browser blocking all subsequent POST requests

This occurred because Terraform's dependency resolution created the deployment before the integration response was properly linked, causing the MOCK integration to fail at runtime despite appearing correctly configured.

### Solution Implementation

1. **Added Critical Dependency in Terraform**

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_api_gateway_deployment" "cfx_deployment" {
     depends_on = [
       aws_api_gateway_method.cfx_post_method,
       aws_api_gateway_method.cfx_options_method,
       aws_api_gateway_integration.cfx_post_integration,
       aws_api_gateway_integration.cfx_options_integration,
       aws_api_gateway_integration_response.cfx_options_integration_response  # CRITICAL ADDITION
     ]
     # ... rest of configuration
   }
   ```

2. **Redeployed API Gateway**

   ```bash
   terraform apply -replace=module.api_gateway.aws_api_gateway_deployment.cfx_deployment -auto-approve
   ```

3. **Verified Fix**
   - Before Fix:
     ```bash
     < HTTP/2 500
     < content-type: application/json
     < content-length: 36
     {"message": "Internal server error"}
     ```
   - After Fix:
     ```bash
     < HTTP/2 200
     < access-control-allow-origin: https://www.jarredthomas.cloud
     < access-control-allow-methods: POST,OPTIONS
     < access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,Authorization
     ```

### Validation and Testing

**Validation Process:**

1. **Browser Testing**:

   - Tested in Chrome and Firefox
   - Verified no CORS errors in browser console
   - Confirmed successful AI responses through the frontend

2. **Direct API Testing**:
   - Verified OPTIONS preflight requests return correct headers
   - Confirmed POST requests work correctly

### Key Learnings

#### Technical Insights

1. **CORS is a browser security feature**: Direct API calls bypass CORS, but browser requests require proper preflight handling
2. **API Gateway deployment timing matters**: All integration responses must be created before deployment
3. **Terraform dependency chains are critical**: Missing dependencies can cause runtime failures despite correct configuration

#### Troubleshooting Methodology

1. **Isolate the problem**: Test each component separately (direct API, OPTIONS preflight, browser request)
2. **Follow the request flow**: Browser → OPTIONS preflight → POST request → Response
3. **Verify each step**: Don't assume configuration is correct based on Terraform apply success

#### Best Practices Established

1. **Always include integration responses in deployment dependencies**
   ```hcl
   # Always include ALL integration responses in deployment dependencies
   resource "aws_api_gateway_deployment" "deployment" {
     depends_on = [
       # Methods
       aws_api_gateway_method.post_method,
       aws_api_gateway_method.options_method,
       # Integrations
       aws_api_gateway_integration.post_integration,
       aws_api_gateway_integration.options_integration,
       # Integration Responses (CRITICAL)
       aws_api_gateway_integration_response.options_integration_response,
       aws_api_gateway_integration_response.post_integration_response
     ]
   }
   ```
2. **Test CORS preflight requests explicitly during development**
3. **Use systematic debugging approach for cross-origin issues**

#### Prevention Strategies

- **Testing Checklist**:
  - [ ] Direct API endpoint responds correctly
  - [ ] OPTIONS preflight returns HTTP 200 with CORS headers
  - [ ] Browser developer tools show no CORS errors
  - [ ] End-to-end frontend integration works
- **Automated Testing**: Add specific CORS preflight tests to CI/CD pipeline
- **Documentation**: Document CORS configuration requirements for future reference

### Business Impact

- **Resolution Time**: ~2 hours
- **Service Impact**: Complete AI chatbot functionality failure resolved
- **User Experience**: Restored full functionality for all users
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Documented findings for team reference and future projects

## AI Chatbot Cost Protection: Token Waste Prevention

### Problem Statement

After integrating Claude Instant via Amazon Bedrock into the CloudForgeX chatbot, the system was vulnerable to cost abuse and token waste through inappropriate or meaningless inputs, potentially leading to budget overruns and poor user experience.

**Specific Issues Identified**:

- **Cost vulnerability**: Short, meaningless prompts ("hi", "test") triggered expensive Claude API calls
- **Abuse potential**: No protection against spam, flooding, or malicious usage patterns
- **Poor user guidance**: Technical error messages that didn't help users understand how to interact effectively
- **Token waste**: Legitimate but poorly formatted requests consuming unnecessary resources

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Requirements

- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimise unnecessary AWS Bedrock API calls
- **Security**: Provide basic protection against potential abuse
- **User Experience**: Maintain good UX while implementing protections

#### Solution Approach

A simple pattern-based filtering approach was selected for its effectiveness and simplicity:

- No external dependencies required
- Lightweight implementation suitable for Lambda
- Effective at blocking common wasteful patterns

### Solution Implementation

A multi-layered input validation architecture was implemented:

#### Layer 1: Length Validation

```python
# Maximum length protection (cost control)
if len(user_message) > 1000:
    return "Sorry, that message is too long. Please keep it under 1000 characters."

# Minimum length enforcement (quality control)
if len(user_message) < 5:
    return "Your message is too short. Try asking something more specific."
```

#### Layer 2: Smart Pattern Detection

```python
def contains_wasteful_patterns(message: str) -> bool:
    """Check if message contains patterns that waste tokens"""
    lowered = message.lower().strip()
    words = lowered.split()

    # Legitimate messages are usually longer than 3 words
    if len(words) > 3:
        return False

    # Block messages that are too short and contain junk words
    if any(word in BANNED_PATTERNS for word in words):
        logger.info(f"Blocked wasteful pattern: {len(words)} words")
        return True

    return False
```

#### Layer 3: User Experience Optimisation

```python
# User-friendly error messaging
if contains_wasteful_patterns(user_message):
    return "I'd love to help! Try asking something specific about Jarred's projects, skills, or experience."
```

### Key Learnings

#### Technical Insights

1. **AI Service Integration**: Understanding token economics and cost optimisation
2. **Input Validation**: Simple but effective validation checks
3. **User Experience**: Balancing security with usability

#### Architectural Insights

1. **Layered Validation**: Multiple validation checks provide better protection
2. **Smart Filtering**: Word count heuristic prevents false positives
3. **Cost Consciousness**: Proactive cost management in cloud applications

#### Best Practices Established

1. **Simple heuristics can be effective**: Word count + pattern matching provides good balance
2. **User guidance over blocking**: Helpful error messages improve user experience
3. **Input validation**: Validate inputs before sending to expensive API services

### Business Impact

**Implementation Results**:

- Simple inputs like "hi" and "test" are blocked before reaching AWS Bedrock
- User receives helpful guidance instead of technical error messages
- Reduced token usage by preventing unnecessary API calls

#### Business Value

- **Cost Efficiency**: Prevents unnecessary API calls to AWS Bedrock
- **Security**: Provides basic protection against potential abuse
- **User Experience**: Provides helpful error messages instead of technical errors

## Security Considerations

### S3 Bucket Protection

The CloudForgeX project implements comprehensive S3 bucket protection to prevent unauthorised access to static content. This is a critical security control as S3 bucket misconfigurations are a common source of data breaches.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "web_access_block" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.cfx_s3_bucket.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

This configuration ensures that:

- Public access is completely blocked
- Public policies cannot be applied to the bucket
- Any public ACLs are ignored
- The bucket remains restricted from public access

### CloudFront Origin Access Control

CloudFront uses Origin Access Control (OAC) to secure S3 access:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudfront_origin_access_control" "cfx_oac" {
  name                              = "S3-OAC"
  description                       = "OAC for S3 bucket"
  origin_access_control_origin_type = "s3"
  signing_behavior                  = "always"
  signing_protocol                  = "sigv4"
}
```

This ensures that:

- S3 content can only be accessed through CloudFront
- Direct access to S3 URLs is prevented
- All requests are properly signed using SigV4

### IAM Roles and Policies

CloudForgeX implements the principle of least privilege through carefully scoped IAM roles and policies:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["dynamodb:PutItem"],
      "Resource": "${dynamodb_table_arn}"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ssm:GetParameter"],
      "Resource": "${ssm_parameter_arns}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each service component has a dedicated IAM role with only the permissions required for its specific function. This approach minimises the potential impact of credential compromise and adheres to AWS security best practices.
