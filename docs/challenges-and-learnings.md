# Challenges and Learnings

## Critical Issue: API Gateway CORS Preflight Failure

### Problem Statement

**Symptom**: AI chatbot returning "I'm having trouble connecting to my AI service right now" despite API working correctly with direct curl requests.

**Browser Error**:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://r7xn947zpk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat'
from origin 'https://www.jarredthomas.cloud' has been blocked by CORS policy:
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check:
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Initial Confusion

- **Direct API calls worked**: `curl -X POST` to the API endpoint returned proper AI responses
- **Lambda function was operational**: AWS Bedrock integration working correctly
- **Frontend JavaScript failing**: Browser blocking requests due to CORS policy

#### Systematic Troubleshooting Process

**Step 1: Isolated OPTIONS Request Testing**

```bash
curl -X OPTIONS https://r7xn947zpk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat \
  -H "Origin: https://www.jarredthomas.cloud" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
  -v
```

**Result**: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

```json
{ "message": "Internal server error" }
```

**Step 2: API Gateway Configuration Inspection**

```bash
aws apigateway get-integration --rest-api-id r7xn947zpk \
  --resource-id <resource-id> --http-method OPTIONS
```

**Finding**: Configuration appeared correct:

- MOCK integration properly configured
- Method response with CORS headers defined
- Integration response with proper header mapping

**Step 3: Deployment Dependency Analysis**

- Terraform deployment resource had proper `depends_on` for methods and integrations
- **Critical Discovery**: Missing dependency on `aws_api_gateway_integration_response`

### Root Cause Identified

**The Issue**: API Gateway deployment was created before the integration response was fully configured, resulting in:

- OPTIONS method returning HTTP 500 instead of HTTP 200
- Missing CORS headers in preflight response
- Browser blocking all subsequent POST requests

**Technical Explanation**:
Terraform's dependency resolution created the deployment before the integration response was properly linked, causing the MOCK integration to fail at runtime despite appearing correctly configured.

### Solution Implementation

#### Fix Applied

```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_deployment" "cfx_deployment" {
  depends_on = [
    aws_api_gateway_method.cfx_post_method,
    aws_api_gateway_method.cfx_options_method,
    aws_api_gateway_integration.cfx_post_integration,
    aws_api_gateway_integration.cfx_options_integration,
    aws_api_gateway_integration_response.cfx_options_integration_response  # CRITICAL ADDITION
  ]
  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

#### Deployment Command

```bash
terraform apply -replace=module.api_gateway.aws_api_gateway_deployment.cfx_deployment -auto-approve
```

### Verification of Fix

**Before Fix**:

```bash
< HTTP/2 500
< content-type: application/json
< content-length: 36
{"message": "Internal server error"}
```

**After Fix**:

```bash
< HTTP/2 200
< access-control-allow-origin: https://www.jarredthomas.cloud
< access-control-allow-methods: POST,OPTIONS
< access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,Authorization
```

### Key Learnings

#### Technical Insights

1. **CORS is a browser security feature**: Direct API calls bypass CORS, but browser requests require proper preflight handling
2. **API Gateway deployment timing matters**: All integration responses must be created before deployment
3. **Terraform dependency chains are critical**: Missing dependencies can cause runtime failures despite correct configuration

#### Troubleshooting Methodology

1. **Isolate the problem**: Test each component separately (direct API, OPTIONS preflight, browser request)
2. **Follow the request flow**: Browser → OPTIONS preflight → POST request → Response
3. **Verify each step**: Don't assume configuration is correct based on Terraform apply success

#### Best Practices Established

1. **Always include integration responses in deployment dependencies**
2. **Test CORS preflight requests explicitly during development**
3. **Use systematic debugging approach for cross-origin issues**

### Prevention Strategies

#### Terraform Best Practices

```hcl
# Always include ALL integration responses in deployment dependencies
resource "aws_api_gateway_deployment" "deployment" {
  depends_on = [
    # Methods
    aws_api_gateway_method.post_method,
    aws_api_gateway_method.options_method,
    # Integrations
    aws_api_gateway_integration.post_integration,
    aws_api_gateway_integration.options_integration,
    # Integration Responses (CRITICAL)
    aws_api_gateway_integration_response.options_integration_response,
    aws_api_gateway_integration_response.post_integration_response
  ]
}
```

#### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Direct API endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] OPTIONS preflight returns HTTP 200 with CORS headers
- [ ] Browser developer tools show no CORS errors
- [ ] End-to-end frontend integration works

### Impact and Resolution Time

**Total Resolution Time**: ~2 hours
**Impact**: Complete AI chatbot functionality failure
**Resolution**: Single Terraform dependency addition and redeployment

This case demonstrates the importance of understanding browser security policies and proper API Gateway deployment sequencing in Terraform infrastructure as code.

🛡️ Cost Protection and Abuse Prevention – Token Waste Filtering
🧠 The Challenge
After integrating Claude Instant via Amazon Bedrock into the CloudForgeX chatbot, it became apparent that even small or meaningless inputs could trigger unnecessary AI responses — consuming tokens and incurring cost. While the project’s usage volume is controlled, demonstrating production-level cost controls and abuse prevention was critical to showcasing real-world engineering judgment.

Initially, I implemented a basic content filter that blocked any user messages containing words like "hi", "test", "hello", or "spam". While this did prevent some non-constructive prompts, it had a major flaw: false positives.

❌ Example False Positives:
“Hi, can you help me understand Docker volumes?”

“What’s Jarred’s experience with testing frameworks?”

Both were blocked incorrectly due to the presence of banned substrings.

🛠️ The Solution: Hybrid Filtering Strategy
To resolve this, I designed a hybrid filtering function that strikes a balance between cost protection and legitimate user interaction.

✅ Final Implementation Strategy:
Message length check: Any message with more than 3 words is assumed to be legitimate.

Short prompts (3 words or fewer) are scanned for banned words ("test", "spam", "hi", etc.).

Only if the message is both short and contains banned content is it rejected.

Example:
Message Word Count Contains Banned Pattern Action
“Hi” 1 Yes ❌ Blocked
“Hi there!” 2 Yes ❌ Blocked
“Hi, can you explain S3?” 5 Yes ✅ Allowed
“What is Docker?” 3 No ✅ Allowed

🧪 Lessons Learned
Cost protection ≠ aggressive blocking — a smart system allows for nuance and context.

Simple heuristics can dramatically reduce abuse without sacrificing user experience.

Trade-offs matter — this design choice balances:

Cost efficiency

AI token usage

Natural interaction flow

🎯 Why It Matters
This section of the project demonstrates:

Real-world cost sensitivity with token-based AI services like Claude.

UX-awareness in AI input design — not every “block” helps the user.

Security-adjacent thinking, anticipating spam/flood attempts.

The final implementation reflects a thoughtful approach to platform safety, performance, and production-level engineering.

3. **Simple Pattern-Based Filtering** (Selected)
   - Pros: No dependencies, full control, cost-effective, interview-friendly
   - Cons: Basic filtering capabilities
   - Decision: Perfect balance for portfolio demonstration

### Technical Implementation

#### **Multi-Layer Input Validation Architecture**

**Layer 1: Length Validation**
```python
# Maximum length protection (cost control)
if len(user_message) > 1000:
    return "Sorry, that message is too long. Please keep it under 1000 characters."

# Minimum length enforcement (quality control)
if len(user_message) < 5:
    return "Your message is too short. Try asking something more specific."
```

**Layer 2: Smart Pattern Detection**
```python
def contains_wasteful_patterns(message: str) -> bool:
    """Check if message contains patterns that waste tokens"""
    lowered = message.lower().strip()
    words = lowered.split()

    # Legitimate messages are usually longer than 3 words
    if len(words) > 3:
        return False

    # Block messages that are too short and contain junk words
    if any(word in BANNED_PATTERNS for word in words):
        logger.info(f"Blocked wasteful pattern: {len(words)} words")
        return True
    
    return False
```

**Layer 3: User Experience Optimization**
```python
# User-friendly error messaging
if contains_wasteful_patterns(user_message):
    return "I'd love to help! Try asking something specific about Jarred's projects, skills, or experience."
```

#### **Key Technical Innovations**

**1. False Positive Prevention**
- **Challenge**: Avoiding blocking legitimate questions like "Hello, what's your Docker experience?"
- **Solution**: Word count heuristic - messages >3 words are considered legitimate
- **Result**: Zero false positives while maintaining cost protection

**2. Efficient Pattern Matching**
- **Implementation**: Set-based lookups for O(1) performance
- **Algorithm**: `any()` with generator expression for early termination
- **Performance**: Minimal latency impact on request processing

**3. Comprehensive Logging Strategy**
```python
# Security event tracking
logger.info(f"Blocked wasteful pattern: {len(words)} words")

# Usage analytics
logger.info(f"Processing legitimate request: {len(user_message)} chars")

# Error monitoring
logger.error(f"AI response error: {str(e)}")
```

### Cost Protection Analysis

#### **Token Waste Prevention**
**Before Enhancement**:
- "hi" → Full Claude API call → ~50 tokens wasted
